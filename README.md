# Diabetes_Prediction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Therefore, our body cannot control blood sugar and over time, it can lead to other serious health problems. 

Objectives:
- Predict if patient has diabetes or not.
- Find what features have the biggest impact on outcome. 
- Test different classification algorithms to find the highest accuracy.

Key Findings:
- The features that have the biggest impact on diabetes are glucose, age, BMI, and the amount of pregancies.
- The classification algorithm with the highest accuracy was found to be Random Forest(76%).
